# Scanbot

Scanbot is an Arduino-ESP32 based 360-degree point-cloud scanner, programmed in C++. It pairs to a computer over bluetooth and performs a full 3D scan of the environment.

Take a look at Scanbot_Arduino.ino for the C++ source file that gets loaded onto the ESP32.

And if you'd like to play around with the visualizer app, download Processing and load up Scanbot_Visualizer_Processing.pde.
